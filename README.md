I'm a recent IT graduate with a passion for DevOps and system optimization. I have hands-on experience in infrastructure, database management, and
cloud platforms like AWS. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and collaborate on projects that solve real-world problems.
Feel free to check out my repositories and connect with me!âœ¨
